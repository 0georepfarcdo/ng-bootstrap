To activate Ekahau Site Survey Pro, you need two things:

- License key for Ekahau Site Survey Pro: You should have received one in your purchase email. If not, contact [Ekahau support](https://support.ekahau.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

After downloading and installing the software, launch it from your desktop or toolbar icon. You will see a welcome message that asks you to create an Ekahau account before proceeding. Click on the link to create an account and enter your personal information and license key. You will also need to confirm your activation by clicking on a link sent to your email.

Follow the instructions and click on Next until you reach the main window of Ekahau Site Survey Pro.
 
## Usage
 
To use Ekahau Site Survey Pro, you need to have at least one wireless network adapter (external or internal) enabled on your laptop. You can check the status of your adapters by looking at the Miniature Signal View on the bottom right corner of the screen. If you see green bars, it means your adapter is scanning access points successfully.
 
If you want to perform an active survey, which measures the end-to-end connectivity and performance of your network, you need to have another wireless network adapter (internal or external) enabled on your laptop. You can use this adapter to connect to the network you want to test and collect ping or throughput data. You can configure the ping host, packet size, interval and timeout by clicking on the Mini Ping View on the bottom right corner of the screen. You can also configure the throughput test parameters by clicking on the Throughput Test Settings button on the top toolbar.
 
To start a survey, you need to have a map of your site imported or created in Ekahau Site Survey Pro. You can import a map from various formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF, DWG, etc.) or create one using the built-in drawing tools. You also need to calibrate your map by setting the scale and orientation.
 
Once you have a map ready, you can select either Continuous Survey or Stop-and-Go Survey from the top toolbar. A Continuous Survey allows you to walk around your site while collecting data continuously. A Stop-and-Go Survey allows you to collect data at specific locations by clicking on the map. In both cases, you need to click on the map whenever you start or stop walking, or change your speed or direction.
 
If you want to perform a spectrum survey, which measures the interference and noise levels in your wireless environment, you need to have a spectrum analyzer connected to your laptop. You can use either an Ekahau Sidekickâ¢ or an Ekahau Spectrum Analyzer for this purpose. When you connect a spectrum analyzer, you will see a Mini Spectrum Waterfall view for each analyzer on the bottom right corner of the screen. This view shows you which channel range the analyzer is currently scanning and how much activity there is on each channel.
 
To start a spectrum survey, you need to enable Spectrum Analysis from the top toolbar. You can then perform a Continuous or Stop-and-Go Survey as described above. The spectrum data will be collected along with the signal data.
 
## Conclusion
 
Ekahau Site Survey Pro is a powerful tool for wireless network professionals who want to design, analyze and optimize their networks. It offers various features such as passive and active surveys, spectrum analysis and end
